                        My experince with unity started after I came to Canada.
                        Unity lets me make what I imagine, with its
                        amazing 2D and 3D building abilities.

                        Python introduced me the path to programming. I use Python for making various utilities, such as
                        web scrappers and <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> bots.

                        Java was my dream language to learn since I was a kid; to make <a

                        Minecraft plugins, GUI applications including <a href="https://www.android.com/intl/en_ca/"

                        I got introduced to Kotlin even before I started to learn Java. When I heard Kotlin is very
                        similar to Java, I started to learn Kotlin and am looking forward to use it on my future
                        projects.

                        When I first touched HTML was when I was grade 1. Although I didn't know much back then. Now, I
                        am using HTML in my high school CS courses.

                        CSS never came easy to me until when I started my CS courses. Whenever I tried to start web
                        development again, I couldn't understand CSS for some reason. I'm using it very oftenly in my
                        web projects now.

                        JS also was a barrier to me. To a young kid who just learned python, the optional semicolons
                        were a huge question mark to him. However, now that I learned JS in my CS courses, JS feels like
                        a very flexible language to me. I now use JS in my web projects.
